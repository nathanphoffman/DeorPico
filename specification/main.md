# Deor Language Specification

Deor is a small, highly-procedural, tabbed-block language that transpiles to Rust. It enforces near-book readability, explicit typing, and predictable control flow — and exposes a `rust` block for when you need the full language.

Its goal is to provide a comfier entrance point to Rust with simple syntactical sugar and such uniform composition rules that there is little room for debate, and when there is debate -- then it offers `rust` blocks for that.

It took inspiration from the following languages, in this order:
- **Python** - block scopes and heavily opinionated readability -- Python doesn't go far enough! ;)
- **Rust** - transpiles to it, allows raw rust blocks, supports a lot of similar patterns
- **Go** - a simple ultra light-weight base syntax
- **C#** - data types and data typing style
- **DD Design** - built in validator types
- **Haskell/React State** - immutable objects with exposed (de)construction tools (in/with/as)
