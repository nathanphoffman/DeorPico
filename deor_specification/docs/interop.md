# Rust Interop

Deor transpiles to a single Rust file. When Deor cannot express something — a data structure, an algorithm, a crate call — you drop into a `rust` block. This is intentional and encouraged where appropriate.

---

## `rust` Blocks

A `rust` block is raw Rust inlined directly into the generated output. It is delimited by indentation — everything indented under `rust` is captured verbatim and emitted as-is.

```deor
fn string read_env(string key)
    rust
        std::env::var(key.as_str()).unwrap_or_default()
```

Deor parameters are available inside the block by their Deor names. The last expression is the return value and must match the Deor function's return type.

Deor does not check this — a `rust` block is spliced into the generated file verbatim, with no awareness of what type the block actually produces. If the last expression doesn't match the declared return type, Deor will transpile it without complaint and the mismatch only surfaces as a `rustc` error against the generated `.rs` file, not against your `.deor` source. Anyone writing a `rust` block is expected to know the Rust they're writing well enough to get this right.

---

## When to Use a `rust` Block

Use a rust block when Deor cannot express what you need — crate calls, closures, `HashMap`, async, type casting, anything that requires Rust's full type system. Do not reach for a rust block just to avoid Deor syntax.

The `raw` type exists for passing opaque Rust values through Deor code. It is the right pattern when you need to build something once in Rust and use it repeatedly — a HashMap built from a list, a compiled regex, a connection pool handle. `raw name = expr` must be assigned from a function call — a bare literal or an inline `rust` block on the right of `=` is a transpiler error (and so is `raw name as expr` — it must be `=`, not `as`).

This is deliberate, not just a syntax restriction. The whole point of `raw` is "Deor can't see inside this value" — but a literal like `5` isn't opaque to Deor at all, it's a plain `int` Deor already understands fully. Only a function call can actually hand back something Deor genuinely can't inspect (typically a `rust`-block-backed value). Requiring the function call keeps `raw` meaningful: if you see `raw x = build_index()`, you know `x` is really opaque. If literals were allowed, `raw x = 5` would just be a relabeled plain value, and the `raw` marker would stop telling readers anything true.

`as` is rejected for the same reason, from the other direction. `x as some_fn()` is Deor's ordinary binding form, used everywhere for normal values — nothing about it signals that `x` is special. If `raw` allowed `as` as an alternate separator, `x as some_fn()` and `raw x = some_fn()` would produce the same opaque value, but only one of them would visibly warn a reader that `x` can't be used in Deor expressions, passed to `len`/`crash`/`s_join`, or reassigned. The explicit `raw` keyword at the declaration site is what makes that unmistakable — so `raw` is only ever spelled one way: `raw name = expr`.

So build it once inside a function, and hold the function's return value as `raw`:

```deor
fn Index build_index()
    rust
        entries.iter()
            .map(|e| (e.key.clone(), e.value.clone()))
            .collect::<std::collections::HashMap<String, String>>()

raw index = build_index()
string result = lookup(index, search_key)
```

This generates the same Rust you would write by hand — no boxing, no overhead.

---

## Global-Style References — Sharing State Across Functions

Deor has no global scope — every ordinary variable exists only inside the block where it's declared. A top-level `raw` type declaration is the one exception, and it's the only way to get something that behaves like a shared global: declare the opaque type once, give it a real Rust definition (usually wrapping the data in `Rc<...>` or `Arc<...>` so it's cheap to clone), build a single instance somewhere central, and thread that instance through function parameters. Because the underlying value is reference-counted, passing it down through many layers of calls is a cheap pointer clone, not a deep copy of the data.

`lib/map.deor`'s `StringMap` (see [Libs](docs/libs.md#libmapdeor)) is a real example already in the standard library:

```deor
raw StringMap

rust
    #[derive(Clone)]
    struct StringMap(std::sync::Arc<std::sync::Mutex<std::collections::HashMap<String, String>>>);

fn StringMap h_make()
    rust
        StringMap(std::sync::Arc::new(std::sync::Mutex::new(std::collections::HashMap::new())))
```

Once `StringMap` is registered this way, callers don't even write `raw` again — they just use it like any other declared type:

```deor
StringMap config = h_make()
config = h_set(config, "host", "localhost")
```

Every function that takes a `StringMap` parameter is handed the same underlying `Arc<Mutex<...>>`, not a copy of the map.

Only reach for this pattern when you actually need reference-style sharing for performance — a large data structure threaded through many layers of calls, or a hot path where repeated cloning would be measurably slow. For everything else, plain function-to-function parameter passing is simpler, keeps ownership explicit, and should stay the default.

---

## The Wrapping Pattern

The recommended pattern is a small rust block inside a Deor function. The Deor function owns the signature and naming; the rust block handles the implementation detail.

```deor
fn string json_get(string src, string key)
    rust
        let v: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&src).unwrap_or(serde_json::Value::Null);
        v.get(&key).and_then(|x| x.as_str()).unwrap_or("").to_string()
```

Keep rust blocks small. If a rust block is growing large, it is a signal that the logic belongs in a dedicated `.rs` file or should be broken into multiple wrapped functions. A rust block should do one thing.

---

## External `.rs` Files

If you have a large body of Rust code that does not belong inline, you can pull it in with `include!` inside a rust block:

```deor
rust
    include!("helpers.rs");
```

The path is relative to the generated output file. This should be used sparingly. Prefer Deor-wrapped rust blocks in `.deor` lib files over external `.rs` imports — they stay in version control naturally, travel with the import system, and keep the interop surface visible in one place.

Only use `include!` when the Rust code is genuinely too large or complex to live inline and has no Deor-facing wrapper worth writing.
